My solutions to Advent of Code 2024, written in Haskell. As this is mostly designed as a learning experience for me, these solutions were produced without using LLM code generation. I did sometimes ask an LLM to help me spot syntax and and other such errors, which can be particularly hard to find when you're new to a language. 

Disclaimer: I do not claim these solutions are optimal, or even particularly good. In fact, I know for sure that some of them are pretty bad, largely due to my lack of familiarity with the language. This is my first time writing significant amounts of code in Haskell. However if a solution appears in this repo it generates the correct answer.
