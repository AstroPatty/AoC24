My solutions to Advent of Code 2024, written in Haskell. As this is mostly designed as a learning experience for me, these solutions were produced without the use of LLMs.

Disclaimer: I do not claim these solutions are optimal, or even particularly good. This is my first time writing significant amounts of code in Haskell. However if a solution appears in this repo it generates the correct answer.
