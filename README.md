Solutions to Advent of Code 2024, written in Haskell. As this is mostly designed as a learning experience for me, these solutions were produced without the use of LLMs.

Disclaimer: I do not claim these solutions are optimal, or even particularly good. This is a learning experience for me. However if a solution appears in this repo, then it generates the corrrect answer.
